      6 Tips to Build a Habit <br />
      that Actually Sticks
    </h1>
    <p class="titledes">
      Building a habit that sticks can be challenging, but with the right
      strategies, it's entirely possible.<br />
      Here are six tips to help you develop lasting habits.
    </p>

    <h2 class="tip">1. Start Small</h2>
    <p class="info">
      Tip: Begin with a tiny version of the habit you want to build. For
      instance, if you want to start exercising, begin with just 5 minutes a
      day. <br /><br />
      Why it works: Small changes are easier to incorporate into your
      daily routine and help build confidence and momentum over time.
    </p>

    <h2 class="tip">2. Be Consistent</h2>
    <p class="info">
      Tip: Perform the habit at the same time and place every day. <br /><br />
      Why it works: Consistency helps create a routine, making the habit feel
      automatic. It reduces the need for decision-making and builds a stable
      context for the habit to thrive.
    </p>

    <h2 class="tip">3. Use Triggers</h2>
    <p class="info">
      Tip: Pair your new habit with an existing habit or a specific cue. For
      example, if you want to meditate daily, do it right after brushing your
      teeth. <br /><br />
      Why it works: Triggers act as reminders and help integrate
      the new habit into your existing routine, making it easier to remember and
      perform.
    </p>

    <h2 class="tip">4. Track Your Progress</h2>
    <p class="info">
      Tip: Keep a record of your habit. Use a journal, an app, or a simple
      checklist to mark each day you complete your habit. <br /><br />
      Why it works:
      Tracking progress provides a visual reminder of your commitment and
      achievements, which can motivate you to keep going.
    </p>

    <h2 class="tip">5. Reward Yourself</h2>
    <p class="info">
      Tip: Give yourself a small reward each time you complete your habit. It
      could be something simple like a piece of chocolate, a few minutes of your
      favorite activity, or a gold star on your calendar. <br /><br />
      Why it works:
      Rewards create a positive association with the habit, reinforcing your
      behavior and making it more enjoyable.
    </p>

    <h2 class="tip">6. Be Patient and Forgiving</h2>
    <p class="info">
      Tip: Understand that building a habit takes time and setbacks are normal.
      If you miss a day, don’t get discouraged—just get back on track the next
      day. <br /><br />
      Why it works: Patience helps you stay committed long-term.
      Being forgiving with yourself prevents discouragement and allows you to
      view the process as a journey rather than a pass/fail test.
